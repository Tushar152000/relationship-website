          These past 5 months have felt nothing short of magical. Honestly, it
          feels like I'm unofficially married to you, baby. And every single
          day, I find myself more grateful than the last.
        </p>
        <p>
          I still don’t know how someone so calm, so beautiful, and so pure
          chose a clumsy, overthinking guy like me. But you did. And baby, you
          have no idea how much love, warmth, and respect you give me—every
          single day. It genuinely feels like all my prayers were answered the
          moment you entered my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even my mom says, “Gungun is incredibly beautiful” (no nazar, please
          😄). And I can see how deeply she loves you—maybe even more than me.
          Because she knows her son is finally in the right hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gungun, your beauty isn’t just skin deep—it's the way you think, the
          way you care, the way you love. You’re beautiful inside and out. From
          the very moment you stepped into my life, everything changed. You
          brought luck, love, and light. You're truly my lady luck.
        </p>
        <p>
          Happy 5th, my girl. You’re not just my girlfriend, you're my forever.
          My love for you grows every day, and I’ll never stop being grateful
          for you. Here's to us, always.
        </p>
        <p>
          With all my heart,
          <br />— Tushar ❤️
