          You deserve to be the first to know...
          <br />
          Jaanu, you're my everything in my life, Tumhare bina main kuch nahi
          hoon. Tumhare saath hi main hansta hoon, tumhare saath hi main rota
          hoon. Tumhare saath hi main naraz hota hoon, tumhare khyaal se hi main
          sota hoon. Tum nahi toh main nahi.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gungun, I notice every single thing – like when we go home and pass
          the colony board, I’ve seen you every time, crossing your fingers and
          praying for us. I can’t tell you how that makes me feel. It brings
          tears in my eyes... (in a good way).
        </p>
        <p>
          I can manifest everything – like your first steps in our first deep
          comfy house after our pooja, and then we hug and say “Baby, we did it”
          – and I promise, baby, we’ll definitely do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gungun, your man Tushar loves you the most. You can fit in my eyes.
          You are the only and last gift in my life. I’ll do everything, Jaanu.
          Bas mera saath mat chhodna.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I think we can wear this bracelet. And I promise: “You’ll never
          see this bracelet off from my hand.” It will always be there on my
          right hand, until and unless I marry you, baby.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yes… I love you the most, Jaanu. Main kabhi bhi tumhara saath nahi
          chhodunga — until our last breath.
          <br />
